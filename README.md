# my-keyboard-layout
used for windows keyboard layoud (qwerty x qwertz mix)<br>
<br>
I use the default pkl.exe with qwerty layout but I changed everything because I also need qwertz with öäü etc. <br>
at this point: yes I am from Germany<br><br>

I need for coding the keys for ;:<> to an easy way of typing<br>
but for documents in german, I need öäüß... <br><br>

to use this without change every time the keyboard layout I used qwerty with german keys set to AltGr<br>
<br>
for example of my layout here is a picture of this:<br>

# features
if you use it and can't remember any of the other keys in this layout press F1 and windows key for the picture as pop-out<br>
<br>
if you want to temporarily deactivate the program press alt and altGr at the same time<br>
<br>
if you have the same issue as me with the default layout you can set it as autostart<br>


# for autostart the programm
windows key + r<br>
shell:startup<br>
past a shortcut from the pkl.exe in it<br>
done<br>
